Through Workshop 3, I have learned many topics and had few difficulties. This workshop covered topics that were related to using private and public members. Private members are not accessed by any member, whereas public members can be accessed externally. Hence, the workshop had members divided into private and public, and to access the private members and modify few data, separate member functions were used. For example, to change the value of a private member, title, setEmpty() was one of the functions that were used to modify the value of the title. Also, when displaying the final results from the data I have got, there were different methods of displaying the data. There were two functions I have used to modify the display and they are width() and fill(). The width() function tells the program the minimum width of the outputs and the fill() function tells the program which characters to put in instead of the white spaces if the text does not occupy the specified field width. Also, when displaying the variables, it could be displayed on a right or left side of the given by writing "cout << right or left << ...". Using these utilities, I was able to display what I was expected to do. Moreover, allocating and deallocating memories from the last workshop was implemented in this workshop as well. Similar to Workshop 2, I had to allocate and deallocate the data wherever they were needed. Finally, I learned that not allocating dynamically an array of Items would cause a big problem.

On a way to finishing this Workshop 3, I had few difficulties I had to face. One of the difficulties was to understand the algorithm or the logic behind some of the functions that were needed to be written. Even though I have understood what Professor Hong wanted me to do, I had struggled to implement the topics I had learned before, such as overloading, pointer, and other topics. Even though I have finished it, I still feel like I need to study more and understand deeper into those topics I am weak at. Another problem I have faced is that the debugging did not work properly sometimes, so I had to turn off the program few times and some of the error messages that were given to me were not understandable. Hence, I had to search online for the error message and look for an answer. However, there were a few that were not searchable, so I had to create small testings and figure out what the problems were. Therefore, working the Workshop 3 made me realize that I had lots of topics to catch up to and study harder.
